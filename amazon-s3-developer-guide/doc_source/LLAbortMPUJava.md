# Abort a Multipart Upload<a name="LLAbortMPUJava"></a>

You can abort an in\-progress multipart upload by calling the `AmazonS3Client.abortMultipartUpload()` method\. This method deletes all parts that were uploaded to Amazon S3 and frees the resources\. You provide the upload ID, bucket name, and key name\.

**Example**  
The following example shows how to abort multipart uploads using the low\-level Java API\.

    }
}
```

**Note**  
Instead of aborting multipart uploads individually, you can abort all of your in\-progress multipart uploads that were initiated before a specific time\. This clean\-up operation is useful for aborting multipart uploads that you initiated but that didn't complete or were aborted\.
