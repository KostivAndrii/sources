This section provides two examples\. In the first example, you configure a bucket for website hosting, upload a sample index document, and test the website using the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the bucket\. The second example shows how you can use your own domain, such as example\.com, instead of the S3 bucket website endpoint, and serve content from an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website\. The example also shows how Amazon S3 offers the root domain support\.
