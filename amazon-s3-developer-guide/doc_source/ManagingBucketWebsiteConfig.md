You can host static websites in Amazon S3 by configuring your bucket for website hosting\. For more information, see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](WebsiteHosting.md)\. There are several ways you can manage your bucket's website configuration\. You can use the AWS Management Console to manage configuration without writing any code\. You can programmatically create, update, and delete the website configuration by using the AWS SDKs\. The SDKs provide wrapper classes around the Amazon S3 REST API\. If your application requires it, you can send REST API requests directly from your application\.
