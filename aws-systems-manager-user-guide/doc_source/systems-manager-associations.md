# Working with Associations in Systems Manager<a name="systems-manager-associations"></a>

In State Manager, an *association* is the result of binding configuration information that defines the state you want your instances to be in to the instances themselves\. This information specifies when and how you want instance\-related operations to run that ensure your Amazon EC2 and hybrid infrastructure is in an intended or consistent state\.
