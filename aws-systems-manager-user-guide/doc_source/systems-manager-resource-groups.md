# AWS Systems Manager Resource Groups<a name="systems-manager-resource-groups"></a>

A resource group is a collection of AWS resources that are all in the same AWS region, and that match criteria provided in a query\. You build queries in the Resource Groups console, or pass them as arguments to Resource Groups commands in the AWS CLI\. With Resource Groups, you can create a custom console that organizes and consolidates information based on criteria that you specify in tags\. After you've created groups in Resource Groups, use AWS Systems Manager tools such as Automation to simplify management tasks on your groups of resources\. You can also use groups as the basis for viewing monitoring and configuration insights in Systems Manager\. For more information, see [AWS Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html)\.
