# Setting Up Automation<a name="automation-setup"></a>

Setting up Automation requires that you verify user access to the Automation service and configure roles so that the service can perform actions on your instances\. Optionally, you can also configure Automation to send events to Amazon CloudWatch Events\. You can also configure an Automation workflow to run when a specific CloudWatch event occurs\. This is called specifying Automation as the *target* of a CloudWatch event\.
