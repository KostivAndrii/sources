# About Systems Manager Inventory<a name="sysman-inventory-about"></a>

When you configure Systems Manager Inventory, you specify the type of metadata to collect, the instances from where the metadata should be collected, and a schedule for metadata collection\. These configurations are saved with your AWS account as a Systems Manager State Manager association\. An association is simply a configuration\.

**Note**  
Inventory only collects metadata\. It does not collect any personal or proprietary data\.
