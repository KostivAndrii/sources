|  GitHub and Amazon S3 Integration  |  **Run remote scripts**: Systems Manager now supports downloading and running scripts from a private or public GitHub repository, and from Amazon S3\. Using either the `AWS-RunRemoteScript` pre\-defined SSM document or the `aws:downloadContent` plugin in a custom SSM document, you can run Ansible Playbooks and scripts in Python, Ruby, or PowerShell, to name a few\. These changes further enhance *infrastructure as code* when you use Systems Manager to automate configuration and deployment of Amazon EC2 instances and on\-premises managed instances in your hybrid environment\. For more information, see [Partner and Product Integration](systems-manager-integration.md)\. **Create composite SSM documents**: Systems Manager now supports running one or more secondary SSM documents from a primary SSM document\. These primary documents that run other documents are called *composite* documents\. Composite documents enable you to create and share a standard set of secondary SSM documents across AWS accounts for common tasks such as boot\-strapping anti\-virus software or domain\-joining instances\. You can run composite and secondary documents stored in Systems Manager, GitHub, or Amazon S3\. After you create a composite document, you can run it by using the `AWS-RunDocument` pre\-defined SSM document\. For more information, see [Creating Composite Documents](composite-docs.md) and [Running Documents from Remote Locations](run-remote-documents.md)\. **SSM document plugin reference**: For easier access, we moved the SSM Plugin Reference for SSM documents out of the Systems Manager API Reference and into the User Guide\. For more information, see [SSM Document Plugin Reference](ssm-plugins.md)\.   | October 26, 2017 | 
|  Support for Parameter Versions in Parameter Store  |  When you edit a parameter, Parameter Store now automatically iterates the version number by 1\. You can specify a parameter name and a specific version number in API calls and SSM documents\. If you don't specify a version number, the system automatically uses the latest version\. Parameter versions provide a layer of protection in the event that a parameter is accidentally changed\. You can view the values of all versions, and reference older versions if necessary\. You can also use parameter versions to see how many times a parameter changed over a period of time\. For more information, see [Working with Parameter Versions](sysman-paramstore-versions.md)\.  | October 24, 2017 | 
|  Support for Tagging Systems Manager Documents  |  You can now use the [AddTagsToResource](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_AddTagsToResource.html) API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Tools for Windows to tag Systems Manager documents with key\-value pairs\. Tagging helps you quickly identify specific resources based on the tags you've assigned to them\. This is in addition to existing tagging support for managed instances, Maintenance Windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines\. New topics include [Tagging Systems Manager Documents](sysman-ssm-docs-tagging.md) and [Controlling Access to Documents Using Tags](sysman-ssm-docs-tagging.md#sysman-ssm-docs-tagging-access)\.  | October 3, 2017 | 
|  Various Documentation Updates to Fix Errors or Update Content Based on Feedback  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html)  |  October 2, 2017  |
