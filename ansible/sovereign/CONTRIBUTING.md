# Contributing to Sovereign

_This document will be expanded upon._

You'll want to set up a [local development environment](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/wiki/Development-Environment) so that you donâ€™t have to test on a remote server.

Make sure you agree with the license (GPLv3). See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for details.

If you issue a pull request, please specify what distribution you used for testing (if any).
Code that is committed to the master branch should work with both Debian 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Debian 8 support is coming up).
