.SH NAME
.B opendmarc-importstats
\- import OpenDMARC statistics/history data 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendmarc-importstats
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendmarc-importstats
is a fairly trivial shell script, typically executed by
.I cron(8),
that rotates an OpenDMARC statistics/history data file to a unique filename
and then attempts to import it to a local database for later processing by
executing
.I opendmarc-import(8).
On successful import, the unique file is removed; on failure, the script
executes
.I ls(1)
on the file and exits without removing the unique file.  The intent of this
last step is to cause
.I cron
to generate a message to a responsible party so that the failure will be
investigated.

.I opendmarc-importstats
