These values come from the [main] section of the puppet.conf on the master:

[root@puppet]# puppet config print basemodulepath
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules

[root@puppet]# puppet config print environmentpath
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments


[root@puppet]# puppet config print modulepath
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules

[root@puppet production]# pwd
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production

[root@puppet]# vi environment.conf # and add the modulepath line as follows...

[root@puppet production]# cat environment.conf
modulepath = site:modules:$basemodulepath

#
# Now let's look at the modulepath again...
#

[root@puppet]# puppet config print modulepath
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/site:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules

#
# See how we now have an extra path element which will look in the production
# environment directory, and site sub-directory?
#

This will be useful later on because it allows us to look in multiple places for modules.

We could then configure things like this:

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/site    - holds modules NOT managed by R10K
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules - holds modules pulled down by R10K
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules                         - holds modules common to all envs
/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules                       - modules that ship with PE

This will allow us to keep role and profile modules in the control repo, without R10K
overwriting them
