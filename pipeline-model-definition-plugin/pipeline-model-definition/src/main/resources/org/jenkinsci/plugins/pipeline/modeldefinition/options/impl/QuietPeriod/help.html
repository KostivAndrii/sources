<p>
    The <code>quietPeriod</code> option allows specifying a quiet period for this project.
<p>
    When this option is non-zero, newly triggered builds of this project will be
    added to the queue, but Jenkins will wait for the specified period of time
    (in seconds) before actually starting the build.
<p>
    For example, if your builds take a long time to execute, you may want to
    prevent multiple source control commits that are made at approximately the
    same time from triggering multiple builds.  Enabling the quiet period would
    prevent a build from being started as soon as Jenkins discovers the first
    commit; this would give the developer the chance to push more commits which
    would be included in the build when it starts.  This reduces the size of the
    queue, meaning that developers would get feedback faster for their series of
    commits, and the load on the Jenkins system would be reduced.
<p>
    If a new build of this project is triggered while a build is already sitting
    in the queue, waiting for its quiet period to end, the quiet period will not
    be reset.  The newly triggered build will not be added to the queue, unless
    this project is parameterized and the build has different parameters than the
    build already in the queue.
</p>
